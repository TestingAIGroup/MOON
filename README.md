# MOON_TestSelection
The replication package of MOON

This paper proposes MOON, a white-box test input selection approach based on multi-objective optimization. The neuron spectrum is proposed to
localize suspicious neurons that contribute to erroneous decisions made by DNN models. MOON formulates the test input selection method into a search-based testing problem. By tailoring a multiobjective optimization algorithm, it guides the search process towards maximizing the outputs of suspicious neurons while promoting diversity in neuron behaviors.
